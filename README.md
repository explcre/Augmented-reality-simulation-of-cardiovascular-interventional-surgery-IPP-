Augmented reality simulation of cardiovascular interventional surgery Mar 2020- May 2021


- Implemented the framework of surgery training assistant system based on augmented reality.
- Predicted the operation trajectory using LSTM and use kdtree to calculate the distance for operation safety warning.
- Displayed the vascular model in augmented reality with OpenGL, and design UI interface to adjust the size, rotation and translation of the model.
- The marker of aruco Library in OpenCV is used to realize the coordinate positioning of QR code.
